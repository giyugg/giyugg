# 👋 Hi, I'm Kyle Acuña!

I'm an **Information Systems student** at **Bulacan State University** with a growing passion for **software development** and technology.<br>
I can't completely say that I am very good at programming, but I am still learning it bit-by-bit.<br>


I'm still learning, still building, and always curious.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning & Working On

- Learning Java, Python, and C++ and trying to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (although I don't know anything on JavaScript yet...)<br>
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,py,cpp,html,css,js)](https://skillicons.dev)
- After mastering those six, I want to learn TypeScript, PHP, NPM, NodeJS, Go, Figma, .NET, C and C#.<br>

## 📂 Portfolio

Here are some projects I'm working on or planning to improve:

- 🔹 [**Java Parking System**](https://github.com/giyugg/cc103_intellij/blob/main/src/BSIS1BG2Group1.java) – in partial fulfillment for our Computer Programming 1 (CC 103).<br>
Status: 🟢 305/350 - Main issue is Night Fee is not working.<br><br>
- 🔹 [**Island Voyagers Inn**](https://www.islandvoyagersinn.com/) – for the company I've been working on.<br>
Status: ⚠️ Still in progress, but public site is viewable.<br>
    - With and without `www`, site is now finally working.<br>
    - Still thinking on my future plans for dependent site booking rather than the current situation (which is email to book).
    - Powered by Cloudflare and Google Sites.<br><br>
- 🔹 [**Personal GitHub Website**](https://giyugg.org/) – experimenting and learning in public.<br>
Status: ⚠️ Still in progress, but public site is viewable. Source code is also [available here](https://github.com/giyugg/giyugg.github.io).<br>
    - With and without `www`, site is working.<br>
    - Also have an email address powered by Google Workspace (you can email me at giyu@giyugg.org).<br>
    - Website is created using pure HTML, CSS, and JS. Tutorial made by [Codehal](https://youtu.be/KqqoL9G7j-c).<br>
    - Powered by Cloudflare, Google Workspace, and Github Pages.

> More projects coming soon as I continue learning and building 🚧
